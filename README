Description: a simple perl script to download files from an RSS feed based on a RegEx



Variables inside file to control most settings, only settings outside the actual script are the feeds themselves. these are stored in a file called 'feeds' (changable in the actual code if you so desire) and should be stored in the format 'NAME,RSS_FEED_URL'


v1.1 - fixed bug that resulted in the program only downloading 1 item
v1.0 - feeds split so each feed has it own downloaded file, 
First Commit = very basic but working


roadmap
- arguements
- individual regex for each feed
- configurable option to delete previous episode of the show
- reestablish websites, only been a year since they were up....
